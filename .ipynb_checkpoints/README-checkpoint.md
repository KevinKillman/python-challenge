 Homework 3
 
 In this Homework assignemnt, we were provided with two datasets and tasked with manipulating the data to display certain statistics and trends in the data. We also had to generate a text file that outputs our results. The first part deals with bank budget data, specifically Profit/Loss.

 With the banking information, I displayed and wrote to the text file the total number of months, net total of Profit Loss, average change of Profit Loss, Greatest increase of profit from one month to another and the greatest decrease as well.
 
 The second part deals with election polling data and wanted me to display the total number of votes cast, list of candidates, percentage of votes per candidate, total number of votes for each candidate, and the winner.
 
 I found both of these task easily accomplished with simple data manipulation. Using for loops and conditional statements, I was able to manipulate the data to achieve the intended results.
